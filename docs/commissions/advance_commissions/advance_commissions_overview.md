# Understand Advance Commissions

Advance Commissions is a feature within V3locity CoreAdmin designed to provide insurance companies and financial services organizations with the ability to manage commission payments efficiently. This feature allows for the upfront payment of commissions to agents and brokers based on anticipated future earnings, thereby incentivizing sales and enhancing cash flow management.

Broker gets commissions on each policy or product that they sell to the groups.
