# About V3locity Core-admin

**V3locity Core-admin** is a cloud-native administration, engagement, and analytics platform that combines full lifecycle benefit and investment administration functionality with robust enterprise capabilities. The unified data model, rules, and workflow engines empower cross-function configuration, reporting, and overall operational control.

## Key offerings

V3locity offers deep domain and enterprise functionality. The domain functionality covers business modules that provide relevant features to help administer retirement, health and investment benefits. 

Enterprise functionality covers modules that provide relevant features to help manage information and processes relevant to large organizations. This means that features like *Workflow Management, imaging, Batch scheduling, template-based correspondence, reporting* and more are provided directly within the core solution without the need for bolt-on, third party components. This simplifies implementation and maintenance. 

This also allows for a more powerful user experience, as enterprise components can interact with domain-specific modules in ways that could not be accomplished using third party integration.

## Key Features

V3locity offers key administrative features for three business verticals – **Insurance**, **Retirement** and **Investments**. These features are capabilities that an organization needs because they are in the business of operating in those domains.

The V3locity Help system is designed to help the users to gain a high-level understanding about the navigation, modules, and configuration of certain business aspects.
