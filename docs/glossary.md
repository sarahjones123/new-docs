# Glossary

A good title should be a short, one-sentence description of the issue, contain
all relevant information and, in particular, keywords to simplify the search in
our issue tracker.

## Description

Provide a clear and concise summary of the inconsistency or issue you
encountered in the documentation or the documentation section that needs
improvement. Explain why you think the documentation should be adjusted and
describe the severity of the issue:

-   __Keep it short and concise__ – if the inconsistency or issue can be
    precisely explained in one or two sentences, perfect. Maintainers and future
    users will be grateful for having to read less.

-   __One issue at a time__ – if you encounter several unrelated inconsistencies,
    please create separate issues for them. Don't report them in the same issue
    – it makes attribution difficult.

> __Why we need this__: describing the problem clearly and concisely is a
> prerequisite for improving our documentation – we need to understand what's
> wrong, so we can fix it.
