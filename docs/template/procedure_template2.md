# How to Brew the Perfect Cup of Coffee

Brewing the perfect cup of coffee involves selecting the right beans, grinding them correctly, using the proper brewing method, and paying attention to the details. Follow this procedure to enjoy a delicious cup of coffee.

## Ingredients and Equipment (Prerequisites)

- Fresh coffee beans
- Coffee grinder
- Water (filtered if possible)
- Coffee maker (drip coffee maker, French press, pour-over, etc.)
- Coffee filter (if needed)
- Scale (optional)
- Kettle

## Steps

### 1. Select Your Coffee Beans
Choose high-quality coffee beans that are freshly roasted. Look for beans with a roast date within the past two weeks.

### 2. Measure and Grind the Beans
For a standard cup of coffee, use about 1 to 2 tablespoons of coffee grounds per 6 ounces of water. Adjust according to your taste preference. 

1. **Measure the Beans**: Use a kitchen scale for precision. Measure out 15-20 grams of coffee beans per 8-ounce cup.
2. **Grind the Beans**: Grind the beans to the appropriate size for your brewing method. For example:
   - **Drip Coffee Maker**: Medium grind
   - **French Press**: Coarse grind
   - **Pour-Over**: Medium-fine grind

### 3. Heat the Water
Heat water to a temperature between 195째F and 205째F (90째C - 96째C). Avoid using boiling water as it can burn the coffee and result in a bitter taste.

### 4. Prepare Your Coffee Maker
Depending on your chosen brewing method, set up your coffee maker:

- **Drip Coffee Maker**: Place a coffee filter in the basket and add the ground coffee.
- **French Press**: Add the ground coffee directly into the French press.
- **Pour-Over**: Place a coffee filter in the dripper and add the ground coffee.

### 5. Brew the Coffee
Follow the specific steps for your brewing method:

- **Drip Coffee Maker**: Start the coffee maker and let it complete the brewing cycle.
- **French Press**: Pour hot water over the grounds, stir, place the lid on, and let it steep for 4 minutes. Press the plunger down slowly.
- **Pour-Over**: Pour hot water over the grounds in a circular motion, allowing the coffee to bloom. Continue pouring in a slow, steady stream until you reach the desired amount.

### 6. Serve and Enjoy
Pour the brewed coffee into a cup and enjoy it immediately. Optionally, add milk, sugar, or other flavorings to taste.

## Tips for the Perfect Brew

- Use fresh, filtered water to avoid off-flavors.
- Clean your coffee equipment regularly to maintain optimal taste.
- Experiment with different brewing methods and grind sizes to find your perfect cup.

Enjoy your freshly brewed coffee!
